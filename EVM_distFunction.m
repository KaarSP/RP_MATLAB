% Parameters
jamIndex1 = 1:23;  % Constant Jamming Distance
jamIndex2 = 24:31; % Constant Relative Jamming Power

% dB values
load EVM_dB_noJam.mat % No Jamming
load EVM_dB_gauss.mat % Gauss
load EVM_dB_sine.mat  % Sine

% Select the dataset to be plotted
dataset = 3;  % Values from 1 to 31

% Fit a normal distribution
pd = fitdist(data', 'Normal');

% Generate PDF
x = linspace(min(data), max(data), 100);
y = pdf(pd, x);

% Plot histogram and fitted curve
figure;

% % Add peak point (mean of fitted normal distribution)

% Alternatively, just use the mean as the peak (since it's a Normal dist)

% Plot the peak
